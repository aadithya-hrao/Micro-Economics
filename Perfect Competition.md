# Perfect Competition

## Introduction to Perfect Competition

Perfect competition is more of a **theoretical benchmark** than a real-world market, but understanding it helps us compare it with other market structures like:

- **Monopoly**
- **Monopolistic Competition**
- **Oligopoly**

### Why Economists Favor Competition:
- Promotes **efficiency**
- **Increases market participation**
- **Lowers prices**
- **Increases output**
- **Reduces deadweight loss**

---

## Assumptions of Perfect Competition

- **Many buyers and sellers**
- **Identical (homogeneous) products**
- **Free entry and exit**
- **Identical firms with the same cost structure**
- **All firms are price takers**

**Key Takeaway:**  
> _No individual buyer or seller has power over price. The market sets the price._

---

## Price Takers

In perfect competition:
- **Buyers** can't affect the price — too many of them.
- **Sellers** can't affect the price — product is identical, and competition is high.
- **Firms must accept the market price.**  
  If they raise prices: no sales.  
  If they lower prices: they lose money.

---

## Long-Run Outcome

- **Firms earn zero economic profit.**
- If **profits exist**, new firms enter → supply increases → price falls.
- If **losses exist**, firms exit → supply decreases → price rises.

> **Result:** Market settles where **Price = Average Total Cost (ATC)** → Zero profit

## Graphical Representation

### Market Graph (Left Side)
- Downward sloping **market demand**
- Upward sloping **market supply**
- Intersection sets **market price**

### Firm Graph (Right Side)
- **Flat (perfectly elastic) demand curve** = Price = Average Revenue = Marginal Revenue
- Firm can sell as much as it wants at the market price

---

## Where Does the Firm Produce?

**Rule:**  
> _Produce where **Marginal Revenue = Marginal Cost**_

Since **Price = Marginal Revenue**, we get:
> _**Price = Marginal Cost**_

In the **long run**, also:
> _**Price = Average Total Cost** → Zero economic profit_

## Example: A Firm’s Production Table (Selling Gallons of Water)

| Quantity | Price | Total Revenue | Avg Revenue | Total Cost | Profit | Marginal Revenue | Marginal Cost |
| -------- | ----- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 0        | $10   | $0            | –           | $5         | -$5    | –                | –             |
| 1        | $10   | $10           | $10         | $8         | $2     | $10              | $3            |
| 2        | $10   | $20           | $10         | $11        | $9     | $10              | $3            |
| ...      | ...   | ...           | ...         | ...        | ...    | ...              | ...           |
| **8**    | $10   | $80           | $10         | $60        | $20    | $10              | **$10**       |
| 9        | $10   | $90           | $10         | $72        | $18    | $10              | $12           |

> Firm maximizes profit at **8 units**, where **MR = MC = $10**

---

## Graph: Firm in Perfect Competition

**Cost Curves:**
- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: Upward sloping
- **Average Total Cost (ATC)**: U-shaped
- **Average Variable Cost (AVC)**: U-shaped

**Revenue Curves:**
- **Demand = Average Revenue = Marginal Revenue = Price**

### Profit Maximization

- Produce at:  
  **MR = MC**  
  → Find quantity

- Profit per unit = Price - ATC  
- Total profit = (Price - ATC) × Quantity

> Positive profit in short run → Entry → Price falls  
> Loss → Exit → Price rises  
> Long-run → Zero profit where **Price = ATC**


## Supply Curve in Perfect Competition

> In the **short run**, a firm’s **Marginal Cost curve (above AVC)** is its **supply curve**.

### Why?

- Because **Price = Marginal Revenue**
- Every price change → New MR → New profit-maximizing quantity

In contrast, **other market structures** have:
- **Downward-sloping demand curves**
- **Price > Marginal Revenue**
- No one-to-one mapping of price to quantity


# Profit for Competitive Firm

## Economic Profit
- Positive economic profit → firm is profitable
- Negative economic profit → firm is losing money

## Key Rule
- Firms produce where **Marginal Revenue (MR) = Marginal Cost (MC)**



## Short-Run Decision: Produce or Shut Down?

| Condition                          | Decision      | Reason                                  |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Price (P) ≥ Average Variable Cost | Produce       | Losses are minimized                    |
| Price < Average Variable Cost     | Shut down     | Losses are compounded if producing      |
| Price = Average Variable Cost     | Indifferent   | Revenue covers variable cost exactly    |

- Fixed costs are sunk in the short run


## Long-Run Decision: Exit or Stay?

| Condition                          | Decision      | Reason                                  |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Price ≥ Average Total Cost        | Stay in       | Earning zero or positive economic profit |
| Price < Average Total Cost        | Exit          | Making losses perpetually               |

- In the long run, no fixed (sunk) costs remain
- Firms exit if unable to cover total costs

# Short Run Supply Curves

## Key Assumptions
- Many identical (homogeneous) firms
- Firms are price takers
- No barriers to entry or exit
- Perfect information

---

## Short-Run Supply
- **Firm's supply** = Marginal Cost (MC) curve above Average Variable Cost (AVC)
- **Market supply** = Horizontal sum of all firms' MC curves
- **Short-run supply curve is upward-sloping**

---

## Long-Run Supply
- **Market supply becomes perfectly elastic (horizontal)**
- Occurs at the price where:
  - `Price = Average Total Cost (ATC)`
  - `Economic profit = 0`
- Firms produce where `MR = MC` and `P = MC`

---

## Long-Run Adjustment
- **Positive profit** → New firms enter
  - Market supply shifts right
  - Price decreases
  - Firms return to zero-profit condition
- **Losses** → Firms exit
  - Market supply shifts left
  - Price increases
  - Firms return to zero-profit condition

---

## Market Shock Example: Income ↑ (Normal Good)
1. Demand shifts right → Price ↑
2. Firm: `MR ↑ → Q ↑` (short-run)
3. `P > ATC` → Positive profit
4. Entry → Supply shifts right
5. Price returns to `P = ATC`
6. Firm returns to original output (long-run)

---

## Firm vs Market Output
- **Firm** returns to original output
- **Market** produces more overall (more identical firms)

---

## Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous Firms
- Homogeneous → Long-run market supply is flat
- Heterogeneous → Slightly upward-sloping long-run supply
  - Some firms may earn profit if lower-cost than others

---

## Shutdown vs Exit
| Term       | Time Frame | Trigger                          | Outcome            |
|------------|------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Shutdown   | Short-run  | `P < AVC`                        | Stop production, stay in market |
| Exit       | Long-run   | `P < ATC` (sustained losses)     | Leave market entirely |

---

## Summary
- Perfect competition leads to **zero economic profit in long-run**
- Firms react to price signals:
  - Enter if profitable
  - Exit if unprofitable
- Supply adjusts until equilibrium at `P = ATC` for all firms
