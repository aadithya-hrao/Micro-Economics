# Costs of Production

## Overview
- Transition from focusing on revenue to analyzing *costs* that firms face.
- Firms aim to **maximize profit**, not just revenue.
- Profit = Revenue – Costs (both *explicit* and *implicit*).

## Example: Conan’s Cookie Cakes
- Fictional example using “Conan the Barbarian” opening a cookie shop.
- Used to illustrate types of costs and economic concepts.

## Types of Costs
1. **Explicit Costs**:
   - Direct monetary outlays (e.g., paying for ingredients, workers).
   - Represented by rubies in the example.

2. **Implicit Costs**:
   - Opportunity costs of using resources in a different way.
   - E.g., income Conan gives up by not being a barbarian, or his leisure time.

## Economic vs Accounting Profit
- **Accounting Profit** = Revenue – Explicit Costs.
- **Economic Profit** = Revenue – (Explicit + Implicit Costs).
- Economic profit is always ≤ Accounting profit.

## Decision-Making Implications
- **Positive Economic Profit** → Better off in the market.
- **Zero Economic Profit** → Indifferent, likely to stay in the market.
- **Negative Economic Profit** → Better off outside the market.

## Example Scenarios
1. **Negative Economic Profit**:
   - Revenue = 1M, Explicit Costs = 501K, Implicit Costs = 500K  
   - Economic Profit = -1K → Stay in barbarian business.

2. **Positive Economic Profit**:
   - Revenue = 1M, Explicit Costs = 499K, Implicit Costs = 500K  
   - Economic Profit = +1K → Open cookie shop.

3. **Zero Economic Profit**:
   - Revenue = 1M, Explicit Costs = 500K, Implicit Costs = 500K  
   - Economic Profit = 0 → Stay in market, indifferent.
# Types of Costs

## Explicit vs Implicit Costs
- **Explicit costs**: Direct, out-of-pocket payments (e.g., wages, rent, materials).
- **Implicit costs**: Opportunity costs (e.g., foregone income).
- The focus in this video: **Explicit costs**, split into **fixed** and **variable**.

## Fixed vs Variable Costs
- **Fixed Costs**: Do not change with production (e.g., capital like equipment or buildings).
- **Variable Costs**: Change with production (e.g., labor, materials).
- In the **short run**:
  - Capital is fixed → Fixed Cost.
  - Labor is variable → Variable Cost.
- In the **long run**, all inputs can be variable.

## The Production Function
- Shows the relationship between **variable inputs** (e.g., labor) and **output**.
- Assumes **fixed capital** in the short run.
- Key concept: **Marginal Product of Labor (MPL)** — the additional output from one more worker.

## Diminishing Marginal Productivity
- As more workers are hired with fixed capital:
  - Output increases.
  - **MPL decreases** (each new worker contributes less than the last).
- This results in **diminishing marginal returns**.

## Cost Curves
- **Total Cost (TC)** = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost.
- **Marginal Cost (MC)** = Cost of producing one more unit.
- Due to diminishing MPL:
  - **MC increases** with output.
  - **TC curve increases at an increasing rate**.

## Conan’s Cookie Cake Story
- Initially, more workers = more production.
- Eventually, workers face:
  - Crowded equipment/space.
  - Logistical/coordination issues.
  - **Idle time increases** → productivity per worker falls.

## The "Little Lie" and the Teamwork Effect
- Initially left out the **Teamwork Effect**:
  - Specialization at low output levels can increase productivity.
  - Leads to **increasing marginal returns** and **decreasing marginal costs**.
- Once specialization hits a limit, **diminishing marginal returns** begin.

# Cost of Production

## Cost Types
- **Average Fixed Cost (AFC)**: Total fixed cost divided by quantity produced.
- **Average Variable Cost (AVC)**: Total variable cost divided by quantity produced.
- **Average Total Cost (ATC)**: Sum of AFC and AVC or total cost divided by quantity produced.
- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: The additional cost incurred when producing one more unit.

## Marginal Cost and Profit Maximization:
- Firms produce where **marginal revenue equals marginal cost**.
- **Marginal cost** is determined by changes in total cost or variable cost (since fixed costs remain constant).

## Cost Curves:
- **Average Fixed Cost (AFC)**: 
  - Decreases at a decreasing rate as production increases. Fixed costs are spread over more units.
- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: 
  - Has a swoosh shape, initially decreasing due to increasing returns and then increasing due to diminishing returns.
- **Average Variable Cost (AVC)**: 
  - U-shaped, influenced by marginal cost. The marginal cost intersects AVC at its minimum point.
- **Average Total Cost (ATC)**: 
  - The combination of AFC and AVC, typically U-shaped.
