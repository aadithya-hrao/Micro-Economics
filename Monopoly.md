# Monopoly
## Monopoly Overview
- **Monopoly**: A market with **one seller** and **no close substitutes**
- **The firm *is* the market**
- **Price maker** (unlike perfect competition’s price taker)
- **Full market power** to set prices


## Monopoly vs Perfect Competition

| Feature         | Perfect Competition            | Monopoly               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Number of Firms | Many                           | One                    |
| Product Type    | Homogeneous                    | Unique, no substitutes |
| Price Control   | None (price taker)             | Full (price maker)     |
| Demand Curve    | Horizontal (perfectly elastic) | Downward-sloping       |
| Entry/Exit      | Free                           | Barriers to entry      |


## Monopoly Revenue and Pricing Strategy

### Key Concepts
- **Downward-sloping demand curve**: Price and quantity are inversely related
- **Monopolist sets price**, knowing that quantity demanded will change
- **Goal**: Maximize profit where `MR = MC`


## Output Effect vs Price Effect

| Effect        | Description              | Impact on Revenue |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Output Effect | Selling more units       | Revenue ↑         |
| Price Effect  | Lower price on all units | Revenue ↓         |

### Revenue depends on elasticity:
- **Elastic demand**: Lowering price → Revenue ↑
- **Inelastic demand**: Raising price → Revenue ↑


## Elasticity Game = Output vs Price Effect Game
- Monopoly compares:
  - **Output effect**: More units sold at lower price
  - **Price effect**: Lower price reduces revenue per unit
- Goal: Find the balance that **maximizes total revenue**, then **set price to maximize profit**
# Why Monopolies Arise

## What is a Monopoly?
- A **monopoly** is the **sole seller** of a product with **no close substitutes**.
- Monopolies have **market power**: they are **price makers**, not price takers.
- They arise due to **barriers to entry** that prevent competition.

---

## Barriers to Entry

### 1. **Control of Key Resources**
- A firm may own the only resource necessary for production.
- Example:  
  - **"Only well in the desert"** – sole access to water means control over supply.
  - **De Beers** – historically controlled most of the world's diamond supply.


### 2. **Government-Created Monopolies**
- Governments may grant **temporary monopolies** through:
  - **Patents**
  - **Copyrights**
- Purpose: Encourage **innovation** and **R&D** by protecting profits.
- Example:  
  - **Pharmaceuticals** – costly to develop, cheap to copy. Patents provide temporary market exclusivity.
- Once patents expire, **generic drugs** enter, and **profits fall** significantly.


### 3. **Natural Monopolies**
- Arise due to the **economics of production**, not legal or resource control.
- Characterized by:
  - **Decreasing average total cost (ATC)** over a large range of output.
  - High **fixed costs** and low **marginal/variable costs**.
- Common in **utilities** (e.g., electricity, water) and **infrastructure** (e.g., toll bridges).
- Graph: ATC curve is always **downward-sloping**.
- **Regulation** is often better than competition here:
  - Breaking them up may lead to **higher costs** and **higher prices** for consumers.

# A Monopoly's Revenue

## Monopoly Revenue vs. Perfect Competition

### Key Differences:
- **Perfect Competition**: Price is **constant** regardless of quantity.
- **Monopoly**: Must **lower the price** to sell more units – a **price maker**.
- In monopoly:
  - **Price ≠ Marginal Revenue (MR)**
  - **Price = Average Revenue (AR)**
  - **MR < AR**

## Monopoly Revenue Table Components

| Concept            | Description                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quantity           | How many units the monopoly produces.                                   |
| Price              | Set by the monopoly, decreases as quantity increases.                   |
| Total Revenue (TR) | TR = Price × Quantity                                                   |
| Average Revenue    | AR = TR / Q = Price (assuming no price discrimination)                  |
| Marginal Revenue   | MR = ΔTR / ΔQ. Falls faster than AR due to price drop on **all** units. |

## Why MR < AR in Monopoly
- Selling more requires **lowering price** for **all** units.
- Example:
  - 1st unit at $14
  - To sell 2 units, price drops to $13 → All units now sell for $13
- So the **extra revenue** from the 2nd unit is **less than the price**.

## Revenue & Cost Curves (Graph)

### Axes
- **Vertical**: Price / Revenue / Cost
- **Horizontal**: Quantity

### Curves
- **Demand Curve (AR)**: Downward-sloping
- **Marginal Revenue Curve**: Below demand
- **Marginal Cost Curve (MC)**: Upward-sloping
- **Average Total Cost (ATC)**: U-shaped

## Profit Maximization in Monopoly

### Rule
- Produce where **MR = MC**

### Finding Key Values:
1. **Quantity**: At MR = MC
2. **Price**: Go up to the demand curve
3. **ATC**: Go up to ATC curve at that quantity
4. **Profit per unit**: Price – ATC
5. **Total profit**: (Price – ATC) × Quantity

## Dead Weight Loss (DWL)

### Why It Occurs
- Monopoly does **not** produce where:
  - **Demand = MC** (Efficient output)
- Instead, produces where:
  - **MR = MC** (Profit-maximizing output)
- So, **some consumers** who value the product **more than the cost** of producing it do **not** get it.

### DWL Area
- Between **Demand** and **MC**, from monopoly quantity to efficient quantity.

## Monopoly to Perfect Competition Transition

**Example**
- Drug with a patent → Monopoly
- Patent expires → Generic drugs enter → **Perfect Competition**

### Effects
- MR curve merges with Demand (like in perfect competition)
- **Price drops**
- **Quantity increases**
- **Dead Weight Loss eliminated**
- Market becomes **efficient**

> We like **competition** because it leads to **lower prices**, **higher quantity**, and **efficient allocation** of resources.

# Price Discrimination

## What Is a Monopoly?
- A monopoly occurs when a single firm dominates a market due to barriers to entry.
- **Three barriers to entry**:
  1. Control of a key resource.
  2. Government-created monopolies (e.g., patents and copyrights).
  3. Natural monopolies (efficient for one firm to supply the market due to economies of scale).

## Monopoly Inefficiency
- Monopolies lead to **deadweight loss** due to price being set above marginal cost.
- This results in fewer transactions than would occur in a competitive market.
- **Consumer surplus is reduced**, and **producer surplus** (profits) increase.

## Market Response: Price Discrimination
- **Price discrimination**: Selling the same product at different prices to different consumers.
- **Three main insights**:
  1. Rational strategy for increasing profits.
  2. Requires information about consumers' willingness to pay.
  3. Can improve efficiency by reducing deadweight loss.

### Types of Price Discrimination
#### First-Degree (Perfect Price Discrimination)
- Charging each customer exactly what they are willing to pay.
- No consumer surplus; entire area under the demand curve becomes profit.
- Theoretically efficient, but requires complete information.

#### Second-Degree
- Prices vary based on quantity purchased (e.g., bulk discounts).
- Targets different buyer types (e.g., individuals vs. resellers).

#### Third-Degree
- Different prices for different groups (e.g., student/senior discounts, business vs. leisure travel).
- Coupons are a form of third-degree discrimination based on willingness to search for discounts.

## Government Role in Addressing Monopoly Power
### Antitrust Laws
- Prevent mergers that reduce competition.
- Break up firms with too much market power.
- Prohibit collusion and coordination between competitors.

### Natural Monopoly Regulation
- Instead of breaking them up, governments may **regulate prices**.
- Challenges:
  - Pricing at marginal cost leads to losses (MC < ATC).
  - Pricing at average total cost removes incentives to lower costs.

### Public Ownership
- Government takes control of the monopoly.
- Risk: taxpayers bear the cost if the firm is inefficient or fails.

## Sometimes, Do Nothing
- Government intervention has trade-offs and risks.
- If intervention doesn't improve outcomes, allowing some inefficiency may be preferable.
