# Household Choices

## Intro
- Shift from firms to **households** (the consumer side of markets).
- In the **goods market**: households demand goods.
- In the **labor market**: households supply labor (workers).

## Three Main Household Decisions
1. **Optimal bundle of consumption** (choosing between two goods).
2. **Labor-leisure choice** (how much to work vs. relax).
3. **Two-period model** (consume now vs. save to consume later).


## Optimal Bundle of Consumption

### Budget Constraint
- Shows what combinations of two goods a household can afford.
- Example: $60 to spend on **wings ($1)** and **beer ($6)**.
- Budget line: like a personal PPF; downward sloping.
- **Slope = relative price** (give up 6 wings for 1 beer).
- All spending = $60 (no waste, no overspending).

### Indifference Curves
- Show preferences: all points on the curve give the same utility.
- **Downward sloping**: must give up one good to get more of the other.
- **Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)**: how much of one good you're willing to give up for another.
  - MRS = slope of the indifference curve.
  - Use ranges, not points (no calculus).

### Key Properties of Indifference Curves
1. **Downward sloping**: trade-offs between goods.
2. **Higher curves = more utility**: more of one or both goods.
3. **Can't cross (Ghostbusters Rule)**: avoids logical contradiction.
4. **Bowed inward** due to **diminishing marginal utility**:
   - More of a good = less additional value from each extra unit.

### Special Cases
- **Perfect Substitutes**: straight-line indifference curves (e.g. gold bars).
- **Perfect Complements**: L-shaped curves (e.g. left & right mittens).

# Consumer's Optimal Choice

## Finding the Optimal Bundle
- The **optimal bundle of consumption** occurs where the **budget constraint** is **tangent** to an **indifference curve**.
- Tangency means **same slopes**:  
  `Slope of Budget Constraint = Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)`
- MRS is defined as:  
  `MRS = Marginal Utility of Good X / Marginal Utility of Good Y`
- Slope of budget constraint is the **relative price** of the goods:  
  `Price of Good X / Price of Good Y`
- At the optimal point:  
  `MU_beer / P_beer = MU_wings / P_wings`


## Income Effects
- **Real Income** = Nominal Income / Price Level
- **Increasing nominal income (holding prices constant):**
  - Budget line shifts **rightward (parallel)**.
  - If both goods are **normal**, consumption of both increases.
  - If one good is **inferior**, consumption of that good **decreases** as income rises.



## Substitution & Income Effects of Price Changes

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Adjust Budget Constraint**:  
   - When price of one good falls (e.g., beer), budget line rotates outward (flatter slope).
2. **Find Substitution Effect**:  
   - Move along original indifference curve.
   - Move **toward the cheaper good**, away from the more expensive one.
   - Tangency with a **hypothetical** budget line parallel to the new one.
3. **Find Income Effect**:  
   - Movement to a new, **higher indifference curve** (if goods are normal).
   - Direction depends on whether the good is **normal** or **inferior**.

### Example (Beer Gets Cheaper):
- Substitution Effect:
  - **More beer**, **less wings**
- Income Effect (assuming both goods are normal):
  - **More beer**, **more wings**
- **Total Effect on Wings**: Depends on which effect dominates.

# Labor vs. Leisure 

## Household Role
  - In the **goods market**, households are consumers.
  - In the **labor market**, households are **workers** supplying labor.

## Labor vs. Leisure
  - Labor is considered a **"bad"** in economics; leisure and consumption provide **utility**.
  - Households work to earn wages to **consume**, which adds to utility.
  - Leisure also adds utility—**work-life balance** is key.

## Wage as Opportunity Cost
  - Wage = **opportunity cost** of leisure.
  - Choosing leisure means giving up potential earnings (consumption).

## Budget Constraint & Utility Maximization
  - Budget line slope = **wage rate**.
  - Households maximize utility where **budget line is tangent to indifference curve**.
  - Optimal point: Marginal Utility of Consumption = Marginal Utility of Leisure / Wage.

## Wage Increase Effects
  - **Substitution Effect**: Higher wage → leisure becomes more expensive → work more, leisure less.
  - **Income Effect**: Higher wage → higher income → consume more and **demand more leisure** (leisure is a **normal good**).

## Combined Effects
  - **Substitution effect**: less leisure, more labor.
  - **Income effect**: more leisure, more consumption.
  - Net outcome depends on **which effect dominates**.

## Graph Interpretation
  - **Left shift (C < A)**: Substitution effect dominates → more labor.
  - **Right shift (C > A)**: Income effect dominates → more leisure.

## Macro vs. Micro Labor Supply
  - **Macro**: Substitution effect dominates → upward sloping labor supply curve.
  - **Micro**: For high earners, income effect may dominate → they work less at higher wages.

# Household Choice – Two Period Consumption Model

## Overview of the Two Period Model
- Period 1: Working and earning income.
- Period 2: Retired; consume savings from Period 1.
- No period after Period 2 – all economic activity is confined to these two periods.
- Core decision: How much to consume now versus how much to save for future consumption.

## Budget Constraint and Indifference Curves
- Budget constraint shows what the consumer can afford across both periods.
- Indifference curves represent combinations of consumption in both periods that yield the same utility.
- Optimal consumption occurs where the budget constraint is tangent to an indifference curve.

## Real Interest Rate as Relative Price
- The real interest rate is the relative price of current versus future consumption.
- It represents the opportunity cost of consuming today instead of saving and consuming more later.
- The interest rate affects the slope of the budget constraint:
  - A higher interest rate makes current consumption more expensive in terms of future consumption.

## Utility Maximization Condition
- Consumers maximize utility where:
  - Marginal utility of future consumption = marginal utility of current consumption divided by (1 + real interest rate).
- Reflects the tradeoff between consuming now versus later in a way that balances utility across time.

## Effects of a Change in the Real Interest Rate
- An increase in the interest rate has both substitution and income effects:
  - **Substitution effect**: Consumption now becomes more expensive, leading to more saving and more future consumption.
  - **Income effect**: Higher interest income increases overall purchasing power, leading to more consumption in both periods.
- These effects can conflict:
  - Substitution effect → less current consumption.
  - Income effect → more current and future consumption.
- Whether the consumer saves more depends on which effect dominates.

## Comparison with Labor-Leisure Model
- Conceptually identical framework:
  - Wage in labor-leisure model is like the interest rate here – a relative price.
  - Leisure versus work decision parallels current versus future consumption.
  - Both models involve income and substitution effects that may move in the same or opposite directions.
