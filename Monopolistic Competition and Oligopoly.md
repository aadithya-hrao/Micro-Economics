# Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly

## Monopolistic Competition

### Key Characteristics
- **Hybrid market structure**: Shares traits of both perfect competition and monopoly.
- **Many sellers**, **free entry and exit**: Like perfect competition, this leads to **zero economic profit in the long run**.
- **Product differentiation**: Each firm sells slightly different products, giving them **some control over price**.

### Short Run vs. Long Run
- **Short Run**: Firms can earn **positive or negative economic profit**.
- **Positive profit** leads to **entry** of new firms.
- **Negative profit** leads to **exit** of firms.
- **Long Run**: Entry/exit continues until **economic profit = 0**.

### Demand Curve
- **Downward sloping** due to brand loyalty.
- Firms face **less elastic demand** than in perfect competition.
- Example: Fast food chains with slightly different burgers and loyal customers.

### Profit Maximization
- Firms produce where **MR = MC**.
- Price is found on the **demand curve**.
- Long run equilibrium occurs where **demand is tangent to ATC**, leading to **zero economic profit**.

### Efficiency
- **Not allocatively efficient**: Price > MC → **deadweight loss**.
- **Not productively efficient**: Firms **do not produce at minimum ATC**, resulting in **excess capacity**.


## Oligopoly

### Key Characteristics
- **Few firms** dominate the market.
- Can sell **identical or differentiated products**.
- **Barriers to entry** may exist.
- Firms engage in **strategic behavior**: Each firm’s actions affect others.

### Game Theory and Strategic Interaction
- Firms consider rivals' reactions when making decisions.
- Outcomes depend on mutual interdependence.
- Examples:
  - Price wars
  - Collusion (illegal)
  - Nash equilibrium: Each firm chooses the best strategy given others' choices.

### Market Transition
- **If more firms enter**:
  - Oligopoly → Monopolistic competition (with differentiated products)
  - Oligopoly → Perfect competition (with identical products)


## Comparing Market Structures

| Feature | Perfect Competition | Monopolistic Competition | Oligopoly |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| # of Firms | Many | Many | Few |
| Entry/Exit | Free | Free | Barriers may exist |
| Product Type | Identical | Differentiated | Identical or Differentiated |
| Price Control | None (Price taker) | Some | Some to significant |
| Long-Run Profits | Zero | Zero | Possible positive |
| Efficiency | High (allocative & productive) | Lower (deadweight loss, excess capacity) | Varies |



## Efficiency Comparison

### Perfect Competition
- **Allocatively efficient**: P = MC
- **Productively efficient**: Produce at minimum ATC
- **No deadweight loss**, **no excess capacity**

### Monopolistic Competition
- **Not allocatively efficient**: P > MC
- **Not productively efficient**: Do not produce at min ATC
- **Deadweight loss** exists
- **Excess capacity** present: Can produce more at lower ATC


## Oligopoly Pricing

### Oligopoly
- Market with a few firms selling similar or identical products.
- Strategic interaction is key: firms consider competitors' decisions when making their own.
- Common behavior includes attempts to **collude**, though this is illegal under **antitrust laws**.

### Duopoly Example: Jack and Diane
- Two apple orchard owners in a small town.
- **Collusion scenario**: They agree to act like a monopoly.
  - Produce 150 apples total (75 each), price at $5.
  - Split total profits of $750 ($375 each).

### Tit-for-Tat Game (Sequential)
- **Game Rule**: Players move in sequence, 30-unit changes.
- Jack cheats first, increases to 105 apples.
  - Market price drops to $4.
  - Jack's profit: $420, Diane's profit: $300.
- Diane responds by producing 105 apples.
  - Price drops to $3.
  - Diane's profit: $315, Jack's profit: $315.
- Jack considers further increase but profits fall at $2/unit.
  - Finds no incentive to deviate.
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Both produce 105 apples at $3, profit = $315.

### Prisoner's Dilemma (Simultaneous)
- Both firms consider colluding (75 apples each, $5 price).
  - Profits = $375 each.
- **Dominant Strategy**: Produce 105 apples regardless of the other's action.
  - If one cheats while the other cooperates: $420 vs. $300.
  - If both cheat: $315 each.
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Both choose 105 apples, lower profits than collusion.

### Key Concepts
- **Nash Equilibrium**: No player benefits by changing strategy unilaterally.
- **Dominant Strategy**: Best strategy regardless of opponent's action.
- **Output vs. Price Effect**:
  - Output effect: More units sold = more revenue.
  - Price effect: More units lowers market price = less revenue.
- In early rounds, output effect dominates; in later rounds, price effect takes over.

### Repeated Games
- Possibility of learning and cooperation over time.
- Players may return to collusion after experiencing mutual loss.
